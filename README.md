## Goal of this project

* build up RL framework for multilegged robots to teach multilegged gaits w/o ground truth markup data
* use accurate physics engine (Universal Mechanism or some other)

## Description
Code source and readings related to hexapod and multilegged robots

Dynamic models are made in the Universal Mechanism(UM) http://www.umlab.ru/en/pages/index.php?id=1 - Multi Body Simulation (MBS) software

The UM software supports external libraries (dll) to run them during simulation.

## Codebase
The source code of all core libraries, test projects and dll projects is stored here

## Readings
Intersting articles related to the project

## UM_tests
UM models are stored here

# Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.4
* Universal Mechanism software http://www.umlab.ru/en/pages/index.php?id=1. Can use trial version for 30 days.
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
